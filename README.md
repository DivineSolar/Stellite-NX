## What is Stellite?
Stellite is the world's first Fortnite Festival autoplayer, with high customizability and a useful featureset.

You can [see an early version in action here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ho50fxCqPs)

## What's new in v2
- Plays from the song's chart instead of just reacting to the screen, so every note is pressed at the exact time
- Holds sustains, so lead, bass, vocals, pro lead and pro bass are playable now, not just drums
- Activates overdrive on its own, following the optimal path from fnfpaths
- Overlay with the song timer (counting down like the one in game) and when the next overdrive is
- One timing setting you tune while playing with `-` and `=`, saved automatically
- Works on Windows display scaling (125%, 150%...), no more crash at 1440p, no more double presses, faster screen reading
- Resolutions without their own match images use the closest ones scaled

## How does it play?
Stellite plays straight from the song's chart. Pick the song and instrument when it starts, and Stellite downloads the chart from [fnfpaths](https://fnfpaths.github.io) and reads every note, sustain, tempo change and the optimal overdrive path out of it.

The game has no way of telling Stellite where the song is, so it still watches the highway. Until it knows where the song is it plays from the screen like it always has, and as soon as the notes it sees line up with the chart (usually a few seconds in) it switches to playing from the chart. From then on every note it sees just keeps the chart in time, and if it ever loses track (pausing, restarting, wrong song) it goes back to the screen until it lines up again.

Playing from the chart means:
- Every note is pressed at the exact time, chords included, with no missed or doubled notes
- Sustains are held for their full length, so lead, bass, vocals and the pro parts are playable, not just drums
- Overdrive is activated on the optimal path from fnfpaths, in the middle of each activation window
- Timing is tuned with one offset instead of a pile of detection values

## Limitations
- Song charts are expert only (5 lanes). On easy to hard Stellite plays from the screen only, which can't hold sustains
- Songs that aren't on fnfpaths yet only get screen reading. New songs usually show up within a few days
- Lift notes (the arrows on lead, bass and vocals) aren't marked on fnfpaths, so Stellite presses them like normal notes. Guides say the game accepts that, but releasing is the official way, so these are the notes most likely to slip
- Stellite supports most standard resolutions. Resolutions without their own match images use the closest ones scaled, which might need the confidence values tuned. You can make your own according to the naming scheme in the assets folder

## Benefits
### Performance benefits:
- Stellite can play the large majority of songs flawlessly on any difficulty, including expert.
- Stellite can achieve high rankings worldwide, even first place, depending on the presence of exploited scores for that song. Overdrive routes are important for podium positions, and Stellite now follows them on its own.
- Stellite does not trigger the anticheat and it never will unless EAC goes the valorant route.

### Account benefits:
- Gain free Season Levels for the battle pass via the Try Fortnite Festival quest line.
- Earn Festival Points and claim free rewards through various quest lines.

## Usage (tutorial video soon)
- Use Python 3.10 or newer (tested on 3.12)
- Play Fortnite on windowed fullscreen, and preferably low quality rendering mode (this makes brightness match with what the match images use)
- Use the setup.bat script to install dependencies
- Run the start.bat script, pick your song and instrument (type to search, Tab autofills, Esc skips)
- Turn caps lock on before the song starts, Stellite only plays while caps lock is on
- If you get Goods instead of Perfects, press `-` while playing until they turn into Perfects (see [Timing](#timing))
- Restart the program after altering the config file, if needed
- Join the discord for the config values explanation

### Upgrading from v1
Replace the old files with the new ones, keep your config.json, and run setup.bat again. Old configs still work, anything missing uses its default. If your old config has `debug_positions` set to `"true"`, set it to `"false"` unless you need it, v1 printed debug lines no matter what that setting was.

### Hotkeys
These all work while Fortnite is open.

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Caps Lock | Autoplay on/off. While it is off the overlay can be dragged around |
| `[` | **Pick a different song.** Use it between songs: press it, click the Stellite window, type the song name and pick the instrument. Autoplay pauses until you are done |
| `]` | **Sync on GO.** Normally you never need it, Stellite syncs itself from the first few notes it sees. If the overlay keeps saying "syncing", press `]` right when GO shows at the start of the song and it plays the chart from there. It does nothing once Stellite has synced from the screen, so pressing it by accident mid song is fine |
| `-` | **Play earlier.** Moves every note 5 ms earlier and saves it. Press it while playing if you get Goods instead of Perfects |
| `=` | **Play later.** Moves every note 5 ms later and saves it, for when you went too far |
| `P` | Exit |

### Overlay
The overlay sits in the top right and never takes focus from Fortnite. Turn caps lock off to drag it somewhere else, it remembers where you put it.
- The big number is the song timer, counting down like the one in game
- `OD 2:31  3rd RY` means overdrive gets activated when the timer hits 2:31, on the 3rd RY chord, and `OD NOW` shows when it happens
- `syncing` means Stellite is still playing from the screen and lining the chart up
- After `-` or `=` it shows the new timing for a moment, like `notes 15 ms earlier`

## Timing
When Stellite plays from the chart every note lands with the same timing, so if one note is a little late they all are. That's fixed with one number:
1. Play a song and watch the hit feedback
2. If you get Goods, press `-` a few times while playing until they turn into Perfects. If you go too far and get Goods again, press `=`
3. That's it, Stellite saves it to config.json by itself and tells you in plain words, like `Notes now play 15 ms earlier`

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chart_timing_offset_ms` | **The main one.** When notes get pressed. Minus is earlier, plus is later, so `-15` means 15 ms earlier. `-` and `=` change it for you | `0` |
| `overdrive_timing_offset_ms` | Extra shift for overdrive only, on top of the note timing. Overdrive has a lot of room, so leave it at 0 | `0` |
| `chart_nudge_step_ms` | How far one press of `-` or `=` moves the timing | `5` |
| `chart_sync_tolerance_ms` | Not a timing offset. How far a note seen on screen can be from the chart and still count as in sync. Only touch it if Stellite never syncs | `50` |

Changing Fortnite's own audio or video offset can move when Stellite needs to press too, since Stellite lines up with what it sees on screen. Set those how you like first, then tune Stellite with `-` and `=`.

These are only used while Stellite plays from the screen (before it syncs, on easy to hard, or with `use_song_charts` off): `min_tile_pixels_top_offset_scaled` (how far down a note has to be before it gets pressed, lower presses earlier), `max_lane_cooldown` (wait before a lane can be pressed again). `keypress_holdtime` is how long each normal note is held in both modes.

## Config
- `use_song_charts`: play from song charts, turn off for screen reading only
- `instrument`: the instrument picked by default (drums, lead, bass, vocals, pro_lead, pro_bass)
- `use_overdrive`, `overdrive_key`: overdrive activation, Space is the default keybind in game
- `show_overlay`: the song timer and overdrive overlay
- `song_select_key`, `sync_key`, `nudge_earlier_key`, `nudge_later_key`: hotkeys
- The timing values are explained in [Timing](#timing), the rest are the same as v1

## IMPORTANT NOTES
Currently the only built in match images are for 1440p, 1080p, and 768p, other resolutions use the closest ones scaled up or down. If notes aren't being picked up you can make your own images matching those in the assets folder with those that suite your game.

Fortnite reworked how lift notes look in August 2025. If notes aren't being picked up, try turning off Lift Notes Connectors and the Good hit feedback in Settings > Game > Festival. The Battle Stage was taken offline in April 2026, so `use_battlestage_tile` is off by default now.

When playing from the chart, the timing is usually the only thing that needs tuning, see [Timing](#timing). Screen reading (before syncing, or on easy to hard) may still need the other configuration values fine-tuned based on your resolution, processing speed, and refresh rate, especially if your resolution is something other than 1080p. Use the debug window for assistance.
